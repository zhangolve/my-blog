#点评
**这首歌最早的时候是看《维多利亚的秘密2010》的时候听到的，当时并没有太大的印象，只是觉得好听，后来很偶然的看了一遍这首歌的歌词，觉得歌词真的很棒，然后就又一遍一遍地听，结合歌词越听越有味道了。之后又接连听了几首jewel的歌，总体感觉都不错，一个四十岁的女人到现在依然有那样的声音，简直是惊艳。**

What You Are
**jewel** 
I'm driving around town 
Kinda bored with the windows rolled down 
See a girl on the bus stop bench 
Dressed to draw attention 
Hoping everyone will stare 
If she don't stand out she thinks she'll disappear 
Wish I could hold her, tell her, show her 
What she wants is already there 
A star is a star 
It doesn't have to try to shine 
Water will fall 
A bird just knows how to fly 
You don't have to tell a flower how to bloom 
Or light how to fill up a room 
You already are what you are 
And what you are is beautiful 
Heard a story the other day 
Took place at the local VA 
A father talking to his dying son 
This was his conversation 
"It's not supposed to be like this 
You can't go first I can't handle it" 
The boy said "Dad now don't you cry, 
Remember when I was a child what you used to tell me when I'd ask why?" 
(You'd say) Gravity is gravity 
It doesn't try to pull you down 
Stone is stone 
It can't help but hold its ground 
The wind just blows, though you can't see 
It's everywhere like I'll always be 
You already are what you are 
And what you are is strong enough 
Look in the mirror 
Now that's another story to tell 
I give love to others 
But I give myself hell 
I'd have to tell myself 
"In every scene there's a perfect plan" 
Everything I hoped to be 
I already am 
A flower is a flower 
It doesn't have to try to bloom 
And light is light 
Just knows how to fill a room 
And dark is dark 
So the stars have a place to shine 
The tide goes out 
So it can come back another time 
Goodbye makes a love so sweet 
And love is love so it can teach us 
We already are what we are 
And what we are is beautiful 
And strong enough 
And good enough 
And bright enough 

![jewel][1]
