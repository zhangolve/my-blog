Node.js 15 comes with a new major release of npm, npm 7. npm 7 comes with many new features - including npm workspaces and a new package-lock.json format. npm 7 also includes yarn.lock file support. One of the big changes in npm 7 is that peer dependencies are now installed by default.

nodejs 14 可以，但是15不可以。
